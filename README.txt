The code in this repository is an experimental analysis of the song attributes from 3 of my spotify playlists. Using the spotify API song attributes were retrieved and recorded in csv format using PlaylistGrab, before being processed in "PredictW10." "PredictW10" experiments with the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm to correctly place new songs in the playlist with the most similar attributes, using 10 of the attributes spotify lists. The program also provides a visualization of the playlist attributes in order to display the differences in song energy, among other attributes. For privacy reasons my ClientID and ClientSecret have been removed, your own login information can be retrieved from the spotify website.
