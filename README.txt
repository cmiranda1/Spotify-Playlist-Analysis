The code in this repository is an experimental analysis of the song attributes from 3 of my spotify playlist. Using the spotify API song attributes were retrieved and recorded in csv format using PlaylistGrab, before being processed in "Playlist Predict" and "PredictW10." "Playlist Predict" experiments with the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm to correctly place new songs in the playlist with the most similar attributes, using 3 of the attributes spotify lists (song attributes can be retrieved using "SongGrab"). Similarly "PlaylistW10," attempts to place songs based on 10 attributes rather than 3. The programs also provide a visualization of the playlist attributes in order to display the differences in song energy, among other attributes. For privacy reasons my ClientID and ClientSecret have been removed, your own login information can be retrieved from the spotify website.
